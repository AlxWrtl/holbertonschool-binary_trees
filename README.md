# Binary Tree Project

## Overview

This project is centered around the implementation and exploration of binary trees in C programming. It demonstrates key concepts like tree creation, node insertion, and traversal methods, focusing on binary search trees (BSTs).

## Features

- **Binary Tree Creation:** Initializes an empty binary tree.
- **Node Insertion:** Inserts nodes into the tree while maintaining BST properties.
- **Inorder Traversal:** Traverses the tree in an inorder manner, printing elements in sorted order.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler, such as GCC.
- Basic understanding of C programming and data structures.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-link]`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code: `gcc main.c -o binary_tree`.

### Running the Program

Execute the compiled program:

```bash
./binary_tree
